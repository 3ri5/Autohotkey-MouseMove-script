# Autohotkey-MouseMove-script
After 15 minutes, mouse moves up and down and then returns to its original position. This is useful for preventing time-outs, keeping active sessions, and anti-afk. Perfect for school, work, and gaming!
<p>This script was inspired by a friend of mine. Written using the AutoHotKey scripting language for most Windows versions.</p>
